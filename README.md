  <p> This website is about some of the interestings things in my life, I dont want to call it a blog, and its not a vlog so lets call this a wlog. Website log, one of the big parts of my life right now is skateboarding, it's my favorite hobby I dont think I'll ever stop. My favorite subject in school would have to be chemistry, the chemical testing part definately not the math. I see myself in ten years as an adult who works at home by doing coding and enjoys skateboarding and own a farm. The farming part is because id like to be a botanist of some sort not because I like farming but because its 80,000 a year plus whatever I make off of my other job. </p>
